## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a meanTorrent application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), at least version 3.4 is required, and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Downloading meanTorrent
There are several ways you can get the meanTorrent boilerplate:

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get meanTorrent is to use git to directly clone the meanTorrent repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/taobataoma/meanTorrent.git
```

This will clone the latest version of the meanTorrent repository to a **meanTorrent** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/taobataoma/meanTorrent/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/taobataoma/meanTorrent/archive/master.zip -O meanTorrent.zip; unzip meanTorrent.zip; rm meanTorrent.zip
```

Don't forget to rename **meanTorrent-master** after your project name.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your meanTorrent application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` and `bower.json` files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

If install process show error info below:

`../node-icu-charset-detector.cpp:7:28: fatal error: unicode/ucsdet.h: No such file or directory`

then run this command to install libicu manual

`apt-get install libicu-dev` OR `yum install libicu-devel`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

Explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options.

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration:

```bash
$ npm run start:prod
```

Explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options.

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ npm run generate-ssl-certs
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute prod task `npm run start:prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`
